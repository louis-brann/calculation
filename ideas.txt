Priority Ideas
--------------
1. Foundation Lengths
    - To a power?
    - Favor even piles?
2. Waste pile lengths
3. Waste pile dependencies
    - Don't bury cards we need soon

Playing strategies to potentially incorporate:
----------------------------------------------
1. Keep one pile open for a K
2. Play onto waste piles intelligently
    - Don't block something that comes before you in every pile (otherwise you lose)
    - Weight the piles by how soon the cards come up, play onto piles that 
      have the lowest
        a) number of things coming up soon (threshold)
        b) sum of things coming up soon
    - If you can play on something that comes directly after you, do

Pruning strategies
------------------
1. Determine when you lose
    - If a card is on top of another card that comes before it in all piles,
      the game is over

Efficencies
-----------
1. Don't deep copy boards for every move
    - Store boards at certain points, and in between, store moves until that
      point e.g. save boards at depths of 2, 4, 8, 16 ; calculate moves
      between them until then
2. Make deep copies cheaper 
3. Move priority function to Calculation game level, and have boards store
   their priority instead of calculating it every time

Statistics to Look At
---------------------
1. Branching factor of IDA at different board sizes. Is there a correlation?
2. How many boards an algorithm goes through to find the solution?


Reports:
1. Ordering which waste pile to try playing on first -- Looking at combos and
   keeping a pile open for K finds a more optimal solution (less moves), but
   it takes longer than simply using the length of the waste pile as the rank
